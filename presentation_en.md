### Passport 

Now I am going to introduce something about Passport and Visa. Here is the defination of passport: A passport is a travel document, usually issued by the government of a nation, that certifies the identity and nationality of its holder for the purpose of international travel. As a Chinese, we get passport only from the Chinese Government. So if you want to go to a foreign county, you should get your passport first. 

Besides a passport identifying you, you also need a visa of the foreign county to enter the country.

### Here is what a visa is:

A visa is a conditional authority given by a competent authority of a country for a person who is not a citizen of that country to enter its territory and to remain there for a limited duration.
Usually a visa is typically attached with various conditions, such as duration of stay, the territory covered by the visa, dates of validity, whether the visa is valid for more than one visit, etc.
Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter a country, and are thus, for some countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country. 
In any event, a visa is subject to permission of an immigration official at the time of actual entry, and can be revoked at any time.
In most cases, you need a visa interview  at the country's embassy or consulate, here is an example <<中国合伙人>> 

There are different types of visas, such as student visa, immigrant visa, visitor visa.
