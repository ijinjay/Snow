### Passport 

Now I am going to introduce something about Passport and Visa. Here is the defination of passport: A passport is a travel document, usually issued by the government of a nation, that certifies the identity and nationality of its holder for the purpose of international travel. As a Chinese, we get passport only from the Chinese Government. So if you want to go to a foreign county, you should get your passport first. 

Besides a passport identifying you, you also need a visa of the foreign county to enter the country.

### Here is what a visa is:

A visa is a conditional authority given by a competent authority of a country for a person who is not a citizen of that country to enter its territory and to remain there for a limited duration.
Usually a visa is typically attached with various conditions, such as duration of stay, the territory covered by the visa, dates of validity, whether the visa is valid for more than one visit, etc.
Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter a country, and are thus, for some countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country. 
In any event, a visa is subject to permission of an immigration official at the time of actual entry, and can be revoked at any time.
In most cases, you need a visa interview  at the country's embassy or consulate, here is an example <<中国合伙人>> 

There are different types of visas, such as student visa, immigrant visa, visitor visa. 

### Green Card
United States lawful permanent residency is the immigration status of a person authorized to live and work in the United States of America permanently.

Ok, now I am going to say something about the differences between visa and green card. As a owner of student visa, you can get a work in the country afer your graduation, and then you can apply for a green card via your company. Once you get your green card, you will get walfare such as Visa-free travel, it means you are free to travel the country with a Chinese citizenship, and you can line up in a queue with the local Americans while visa owners need to line up in another queue which is usually much more slower and strict security check. 
And a green card should be registered at least once a year.If you do not register, it would be very troublesome that you should certify your information to restore your green card. Otherwise, your green card will be revoked. 
So in order to maintain the validity of your green card, you need back to the country at lease once a year. Certainly, there is another way. If you know you cann't get back into the US, you can apply a Re-entry Permit before you leave the US. But this card is also timelimited, you are allowed two year to back into the US. 

Once you hold your green card for five years and you didnot do unlawful act, you can apply for citizenship of America. 

#### Rights of citizenship
1. Freedom to reside and work. 
2. Freedom to enter and leave the United States.
3. Voting for federal office in all fifty states and the District of Columbia is restricted to citizens only.
4. Freedom to stand for public office.

#### Benefits of citizenship
1. Consular protection outside the United States. 
2. Increased ability to sponsor relatives living abroad.
3. Ability to invest in U.S. real property without triggering FIRPTA.
4. Transmission of U.S. citizenship to children born abroad.
5. Protection from deportation.

For Chinese people, the difference between green card and having a citizensihip of America is that you can free go back to China with green card while you need a visa of China to get back into China as an America citizen.


### About The Terminal

OK, having discussed visa, green card and citizenship, I'd like to talk about a film called The Terminal directed by Steven Spielberg starring Tom Hanks. Krakozhian traveler Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid due to the outbreak of a civil war in Krakozhia, his homeland. As a result, the United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation, and he is not permitted to either enter the country or return home. Unable to communicate in proper English, he is forced to hand over his passport and ticket to the police.
The delay gives Viktor enough time to go into the city. Dixon, watching Viktor leave the airport, decides not to pursue him. Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. Then he gets in a taxi, telling the driver, "I am going home."
